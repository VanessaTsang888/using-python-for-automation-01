Understand HTML Structure

Ever wondered how the web weaves its magic, turning a jumble of code into the dynamic pages you navigate daily? In this lesson, you'll review some of the basics of HTML and unravel the intricacies of the web. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and works by categorizing different elements of an HTML document with specific tags. Every HTML document starts with a document type declaration at the top, !DOCTYPE html. This helps browsers display webpages correctly. Next, the content of the HTML document begins with the HTML tag and ends with the /HTML tag. Then there's the head of the HTML document, which begins with the head tag and ends with the /head tag. This part is not displayed in the browser when the page is loaded. It contains metadata, such as the page title, links to CSS if you choose to style your HTML content with CSS, links to custom favicons, the author and important keywords. The body of the HTML document begins with the body tag and ends with the /body tag. Inside the body, you can have headings and paragraphs. Headings are defined by the H1 through H6 tags. An H1 heading will be displayed by the browser in a larger font, then an H2 heading and so on. A paragraph begins with the P tag and ends with the /P tag. Now, there are lots of other HTML tags as well, but these are the building blocks. Understanding HTML structure is a foundational skill for anyone using Python for web automation.

Whether you're scraping data, testing web applications, or interacting with dynamic web content, a strong grasp of HTML enables you to navigate through websites effectively and automate various tasks with precision.

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page title here</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```
