with Lavanya Vijayan.

## In Details

We've discovered the basics of the many ways Python can automate your computer operations. Every automation technique you've learned can be explored in greater detail, so the journey is far from over. Here are a few more resources you can use to automate tasks with Python.

Check out the online book titled <mark>"Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"</mark> by Al Sweigart. He crafts an exceptional read, which progresses from the basics of Python, all the way to automating daily operations that make your life easier. I also recommend that you check out the official documentation for Requests, Beautiful Soup and Selenium. These docs go more in depth about the different functionalities and capabilities, which can help inform how you use these libraries in your projects. Finally, I encourage you to continue practicing automation in Python. Developing this skill will not only transform how you approach problems, but also prepare you for what's to come in a world built on automation.
